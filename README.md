# Hi, I'm Franco! 👋
# ![Waterfall](https://github.com/diprefranco/diprefranco/blob/main-readme-syntax/files/waterfall.jpg)

A passionate **Full Stack Developer** with expertise in:
- **Frontend**: Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Backend**: C# .NET, Entity Framework, Web APIs.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQL Server.

For me, software development is all about ideas. Software is ideas in action—a way to make concepts come alive. Code is more than syntax; it’s a medium to express ideas and solve problems. While delivering quality code and solutions is vital, it’s equally important to remember that, at its core, we are building ideas to address real-world challenges.

## Hobbies

Beyond coding, I enjoy:
- 🏃‍♂️ Running and hiking.
- 🎶 Music and films.
- 📚 Reading, learning languages (English, Italian, Spanish).
- 🛶 Kayaking and exploring nature.
- ✈️ Traveling.
