A passionate **Full Stack Developer** with expertise in:
- **Frontend**: Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Backend**: C# .NET, Entity Framework, Web APIs.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQL Server.

I love discussing ideas, and software is ideas running.
Code is a way to express ideas.
We are constantly focused on delivering quality solutions, quality code. That’s great and also necessary.
But we cannot lose focus on that at a higher level we are building ideas, solutions to problems.

## Hobbies

Beyond coding, I enjoy:
- 🏃‍♂️ Running and hiking.
- 🎶 Music and films.
- 📚 Reading, learning languages (English, Italian, Spanish).
- 🛶 Kayaking and exploring nature.
- ✈️ Traveling.
